Question 3:
In the language of your choice, give me the code that can find the difference of 2 diagonals in a given NxN matrix (principle - Secondary).  The inputs would be N, followed by the values of the NxN matrix.

Input :
4
followed by:
1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1
7 8 9 6
6 5 4 3
Output : -4

Principal Diagonal (Right to left): 16
Secondary Diagonal (Left to Right): 20
Diff: 16 - 20 = -4
